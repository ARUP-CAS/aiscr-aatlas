    perex_big: Welcome to the website of the Archaeological Atlas of the CR! Our aim is to present some of the most typical archaeological sites on our territory and to enable you a visit of them.

    perex_small: |
      The website is based on two published %{books_link} and other %{others_link} but in some respects, it broadens the scope of them. On this website, you will find short descriptions of the selected sites, their geographic coordinates, photo galleries, maps and plans for download and a choice of full-text articles for further reading.

      By now, information on %{count} archaeological sites is available here.

    perex: For a detailed study, select a site from the list below. You can also use the full-text search window or filter sites by their type and/or archaeological period. Alternatively, you can search for sites in the map. Here, you will find a short description of each site, basic maps and site plans, as well as a set of photographs, which will be upgraded in the future as far as possible.  More information can be gained from our printed %{publications_link} and from specialized literature in general, references to which are given in the chapters on individual sites. The complete list of bibliographic entries is available in the %{downloads_link} section; full-text versions of some articles appear under the %{publications_link} tab.
